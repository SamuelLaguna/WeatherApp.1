# WeatherApp.1



Reviewed by: Aaron Perez -  The current wether and 5 day functionality works, pulling in the correct data from the users search input. I would like to see Improvement on the design. The text can be made larger and not as thin to be more readable. The blue background and black text color makes it hard to read. The favorite list only updates 5 day forecast and not the current.
